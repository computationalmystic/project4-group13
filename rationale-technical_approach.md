# Group 13 - Rationale for Technical Approach
---
### Our group's main project goals:
- We wanted to use charts to visually represent the data we were getting.
- The UI needed to be easy to use and aesthetically satisfactory.
- We wanted the data represented to not be trivial.

### Breakdown of skills:
- Derek: Front-end
- Trey: API
- Jacob: Back-end

## Technical approach based off of skills:
- Since Derek's focus was on front-end, he did most of the web design & development work, including setting up Github Pages.
- Trey focused on the API; pulling, parsing, and formatting the data to be used in the charts.
- With little back-end work, Jacob set up the JS charts, did troubleshooting on the API calls, and minor web dev work.
